    "* **ON Button:** When pressed, it turns the LED ON.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **OFF Button:** When pressed, it turns the LED OFF.\n",

    "You are working as an IoT trainee at a smart home company. The company wants to design a Press-and-Hold Lamp prototype using a Raspberry Pi Pico.\n",

    "* When the **button is released**, the LED turns **OFF** immediately.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Write clean and reusable code.**\n",

    "* **A doorbell indicator light** that flashes once when pressed.\n",

    "\n",

    "* A **button is pressed** to trigger the confirmation.\n",

    "* **Remote control pairing**: a light blinks multiple times to confirm pairing success.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Security systems**: a lamp blinks to confirm an alarm has been armed/disarmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IoT devices**: LEDs blink in a pattern to indicate a successful Wi-Fi connection.\n",
