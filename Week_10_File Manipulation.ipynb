    "# File Manipulation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**File manipulation** in Python is the process of working with files such as `txt`, `CSV`, or other data formats to store, retrieve, and manage information on a storage medium, such as your local disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides simple built-in functions and a clear, easy-to-understand syntax that make it straightforward to perform common file manipulation tasks, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opening a file to access its contents\n",
    "- Reading data from a file\n",
    "- Writing or appending new data to a file\n",
    "- Closing the file to save changes and free system resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why File Manipulation Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, whenever we run a program, none of the data entered has been saved. We lose it as soon as the program exits. File manipulation allows us to:\n",
    "- Save data to files using different modes\n",
    "- Read data from files efficiently\n",
    "- Handle different file formats (text, CSV, JSON)\n",
    "- Implement best practices for robust file operations\n",
    "- Handle errors gracefully when working with files\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Setup: Creating a Working Directory\n",
    "Let's first create a dedicated folder for our file operations to keep things organised:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a working directory for our files\n",
    "work_dir = Path('C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/file_examples')\n",
    "work_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f\" Working directory created: {work_dir.absolute()}\")\n",
    "print(f\" Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}\")\n",
    "print(f\" All files will be saved in: {work_dir.absolute()}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##  The File Handling Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files in Python, we typically follow this workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open** - Establish a connection to the file\n",
    "2. **Process** - Read from or write to the file\n",
    "3. **Close** - Save changes and release system resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Traditional Way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Traditional approach (not recommended)\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # Step 1: Open\n",
    "content = file.read()             # Step 2: Process\n",
    "file.close()                      # Step 3: Close (easy to forget!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python Way (Context Manager):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Recommended approach using 'with' statement\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:  # Step 1: Open\n",
    "    content = file.read()                # Step 2: Process\n",
    "# Step 3: Close happens automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement is called a **context manager**. It ensures the file is closed correctly even if an error occurs during processing. This is why we'll use it throughout this lesson.\n",

    "## Writing to a File\n",
    "To write to a file, we use the `open` function with the mode set to `'w'` (write). If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it does exist, it will be overwritten. Be careful with the file path that you provide, as it will overwrite any existing file with the same name. For everything that we do in this session, `'C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/Filemainipulation/' `is the path to the folder in your computer where we will save our files. You can change this to any folder you have access to in your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `file.write` function then allows us to write to the file. This works in a similar way to `print`, but instead of printing to the console, it writes to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/Filemanipulation/example.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check your Filemanipulation folder and  you should see a file called example.txt with the contents Hello, World!.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the code above to write a different message to the file, \"Goodbye, Universe\". Check your file again to see the new contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that the file's contents have been replaced with the new message. Therefore, the current mode of file access is overwrite. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Append mode (adding to a file)\n",
    "To append/add to a file, rather than overwrite it, we use the `open` function with the mode set to `'a'` (append). This will add new content to the end of the file without deleting the existing content.\n",
    "In the code below, we will append a new line to the `example.txt` file.  Only the mode of the file access has changed to `'a'` (append).  The rest of the code is the same as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/Filemanipulation/example.txt', 'a') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('This is a file in Google Drive.\\n')\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Check your file again to see its new contents. You should see that the new line has been added to the end of the file without deleting the existing content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's that \\n character?\n",
    "The `\\n `character is a newline character. It tells Python to start a new line in the file. If you don't include it, the new content will be added to the end of the last line without starting a new line. Run the code above again and check the file contents again. You should see that the sentence starts on a new line. This is because the previous line ended with a newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mini-Task\n",
    "Create a new file called `python_topics.txt` and write a few lines of text to it. Use the `append` mode to add more lines to the file. Make sure to include some newline characters (\\n) to separate the lines. Check your folder to see the contents of the file.\n",

    "## X mode (exclusive creation)\n",
    "The `'x'` mode is used to `create a new file`, but it will raise an `error` if the file already exists. This is useful when you want to ensure you don't overwrite an existing file. Run the code below and observe the output.\n",

    "## Read mode\n",
    "Finally, to read a file, we use the `open` function with the mode set to `'r'` (read). This will open the file for reading. If the file does not exist, it will raise an error. We can then use the `file.read` function to read the contents of the file. This will return the entire contents of the file as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/Filemanipulation/example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read line by line\n",
    "We can read a single line from a file using the `file.readline` function. This will read the next line from the file and return it as a string. If there are no more lines to read, it will return an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/Filemanipulation/example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    line = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(line)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This only reads the first line, though! Remember, readline `reads one line and then stops`. If we want to read the next line, we can call readline repeatedly until we reach the end of the file.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/Filemanipulation/example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    line = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(line)  # strip() removes the newline character at the end of the line\n",
    "    line = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(line)\n",
    "    line = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(line)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we know that the above is silly as there's a lot of repetition, and we don't always know how many lines there are in a file. Instead, we can use a `for loop` to iterate over the lines in the file. This will read each line in turn until it reaches the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('C:/Users/user/OneDrive/Desktop/Filemanipulation/example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    for line in file:\n",
    "        print(line)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you may notice that on the print statement, the lines are printed with a newline character at the end. This is because the `readline` and `for` loop methods read the newline character at the end of each line. If you want to remove it, you can use the `strip()` method on the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('/content/drive/My Drive/example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
