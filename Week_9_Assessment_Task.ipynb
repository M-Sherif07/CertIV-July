    "\n",
    "You have been commissioned by the **National Technology Museum** to prototype an **IoT-based motion detection alarm system** for its artifact storage room.\n",
    "The museum wants a **simple, reliable, and interactive system** that alerts staff to any motion detected after hours, while allowing authorised users to arm, disarm, and mute the system using **physical buttons**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your prototype will be deployed on a **Raspberry Pi Pico** microcontroller and must integrate sensors, actuators, and status outputs to mimic a real-world smart security device.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Design, build, and test a working **Museum Heist Detector** that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses a **PIR motion sensor** to detect movement.\n",
    "2. Activates a **buzzer and LED** alarm when motion is detected.\n",
    "3. Uses **three physical buttons** to:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Arm/Disarm the system.\n",
    "   * Mute/Unmute the buzzer.\n",
    "   * Display system status on the serial monitor.\n",
