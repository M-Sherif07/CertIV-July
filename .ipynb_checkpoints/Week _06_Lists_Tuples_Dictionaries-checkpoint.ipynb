    "Up until now, we have been storing data in variables.  A limitation of this is that we can only store one value in a variable.  There are many cases in which we need to store multiple values.  For example, the names of all students in a class.  We could create a variable for each student, but that would be very restrictive.  We would also need to know the number of students we have before we begin.\n",

    "A better way to store multiple values is to use a list.  A list is a collection of values that can be of any type.  Lists allow us to store multiple values in a single variable.  We can then access those variables individually using an index.  This can be visualised as a table, where each row is a value in the list and the columns are the indices.\n",

    "## For - another type of loop\n",
    "`for` loops are another type of loop that is commonly used in programming.  They are often used to iterate over a list or a range of numbers.  The syntax for a `for` loop is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in list:\n",
    "    # do something with variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalent `for` loop for the previous example would be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = ['Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie', 'David']\n",
    "for name in names:\n",
    "    print(name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `for` loop automatically handles the counter for us, so we don't need to create one ourselves.  This makes the code cleaner and easier to read.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop will iterate over each value in the list and assign it to the variable `name`.  We can then use this variable to perform an action on each value in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could for example add a surname of 'Smith' to each name in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = ['Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie', 'David']\n",
    "for name in names:\n",
    "    print(name + ' Smith')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`for` loops are a great way to iterate over lists as we don't need to worry about the counter and thus stuck in an infinite loop.  We can also use the `range` function to create a list of numbers to iterate over.  For example, to print the numbers from 0 to 9, we can use the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wish to access the iterator value, we can use the variable `i` in the loop.  This is similar to using a counter in a `while` loop. The syntax is a little tricky...\n",

    "for i, name in enumerate(names):\n",

    "## Tuples\n",
    "Tuples are similar to lists, but they are *immutable*.  This means that once we create a tuple, we cannot change its values.  Tuples are created using parentheses instead of square brackets.  For example, we can create a tuple of students as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "students = ('Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie', 'David')\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can access the values in a tuple using the same syntax as lists.  For example, to access the first student in the tuple, we can use the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(students[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will print `Bob`, which is the first student in the tuple.  We can also use the `len` function to get the size of the tuple.  For example, to get the size of the tuple, we can use the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(len(students))\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will print `4`, which is the size of the tuple.  We can also use the `in` operator to check if a value is in the tuple.  For example, to check if `Alice` is in the tuple, we can use the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Alice' in students)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are often used to store values that have a relation to one another.  For example, we can use a tuple to store the coordinates of a point in 2D space.  We can create a tuple of coordinates as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "coordinates = (3, 4)\n",
    "```\n",
