    "### Scenario:\n",
    "As part of our TechVision Kids STEM learning initiative, we’re designing an exciting hands-on activity that introduces students to Analog input, digital output, and real-time control using MicroPython.\n",

    "In this project, you'll use a potentiometer to control the speed of an LED chase animation. As the potentiometer is turned, the LEDs will light up faster or slower — giving students a real-time visual demonstration of how input from a sensor affects output behaviour.\n",

    "### Scenario\n",
    "A primary school teacher, Ms. Harper, wants to engage her students in math lessons by introducing games that use dice rolls. However, traditional dice often get lost or cause classroom disruptions. To resolve this, she wants a simple, interactive, visual electronic dice that students can operate by pressing a button. When pressed, the dice should randomly display one of six numbers by illuminating the corresponding LED (1-6) and simultaneously print the dice result clearly on a connected console. This helps her keep track of each roll and facilitates a way for students to verify the dice result easily.\n",
